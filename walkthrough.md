---

## 🎬 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Watch & Screenplay Sync (`src/app/watch/[id]/page.tsx` & `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`)
- **Split-Screen Cinema View**: Renders the custom video player on the left and a beautifully formatted, synchronized screenplay script panel on the right on desktop layouts.
- **Screenplay Sync Engine**: Listens to the player's active timestamp using an `onTimeUpdate` callback and automatically highlights the current dialogue segment or action cue.
- **Auto-Scrolling Script Panel**: Uses React refs to automatically scroll the active script segment into view smoothly.
- **Letterboxd-style Review Hub**:
  - Star ratings selector (supporting half stars from 0.5 to 5.0) powered by an interactive range slider.
  - SVG Half-Star Gradient rendering: Uses CSS linear-gradients to draw perfect half-filled stars.
  - Aggregated Star Rating bar-chart: Visualizes the distribution of 1 to 5 star ratings.
  - Review feed: Displays user-logged review cards complete with like counters, avatars, and dates.

### 2. Crew Finder & Jobs Marketplace (`src/app/community/page.tsx`)
- **Unified Opportunities Board**: Divides listings into **Casting Calls** (Actors, Models) and **Crew Finder** (Director of Photography, Composer, Editor, Sound Designer).
- **Multi-Criteria Filter Panel**: Filters opportunities by Role Type (Casting vs. Crew), Budget (Paid vs. Collaboration), and Location (Remote, On-Set, Hybrid).
- **Application Submission modal**: Captures the applicant's name, email, portfolio/reel URL, and cover pitch. Submissions trigger immediate canvas confetti bursts and sync with the database store.

### 3. Backstage Opportunity Manager (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Job Listings Publisher**: Implements a creation form for creators to post casting calls or crew requirements, instantly publishing them to the `/community` board.
- **Submissions Review Panel**: Displays incoming applications for the creator's listings in real-time, displaying emails, portfolio links, and pitches.
- **Interactive Vetting Controls**: Creators can Approve or Decline candidates, which updates application status badges immediately.

### 4. Creative Resume Builder (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- **Ecosystem Stats Card**: aggregates metrics like total watch hours logged, reviews written, and verified project counts.
- **Professional Timeline**: Displays the user's credits, roles, and narrative contributions on the platform.
- **Applications Status Tracker**: Tracks submitted applications, displaying status badges updated from the dashboard manager.
- **Portfolio Actions**: Clickable triggers to copy a custom portfolio link to the clipboard and simulate a PDF resume export.

### 5. Hydration-Safe Database Store (`src/lib/supabaseStore.ts` & `src/lib/mockData.ts`)
- **Reviews & Ratings Store**: Saves user star-ratings and review texts, dynamically recalculating the media item's overall rating on a 10-point scale.
- **Jobs & Applications Store**: Manages casting and crew job listings, application submissions, and application status approvals.
- **Mock Datasets**: Pre-populated with detailed screenplays for Shivanshi's original clips and starter crew opportunities.

### 6. Catalog Cleanups & Cache-Busting Storage Invalidation (`src/lib/mockData.ts` & `src/lib/supabaseStore.ts`)
- **Removed Media Items**: Removed "Neon Monsoon" (`media-3`), "Chasing Shadows" (`media-4`), "The Sound of Stone" (`media-6`), and "SILENCE GLANCES, GOLDEN MOMENTS" (`media-coming-5`) from the mock database, homepage tracks, and footer links.
- **Watch History Defaults**: Replaced deleted mock media items in default user history and offline downloads with active ones.
- **Cache-Busting Storage Invalidation**: Bumped local storage schemas in `supabaseStore.ts` to `oldverse_media_v11`, `oldverse_history_logs_v3`, and `oldverse_offline_downloads_v3` to invalidate obsolete media records and load the updated catalog cleanly.
